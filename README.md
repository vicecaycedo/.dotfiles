# `~/.dotfiles`

A collection of configuration files for my development environment.

## FAQs

### How do you manage your dotfiles?

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html), which
explains the strange-looking directory structure.

### Are some files missing?

Yes. My Google-specific configuration is confidential and not included.
